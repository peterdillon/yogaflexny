<p>As an adult, Tara pursued and devoted herself to a career in the special education/mental health field and received a Masters degree in Psychology and Behavior Analysis. Following the birth of her daughter, Tara’s focus returned the lessons she learned in her own youth. She wanted teach her child how to live life with a strong mind and body; but more-so how to take anything life can throw at her.

<p>Chris Olstrom started practicing Bikram Yoga in early 2007 after years of long distance running left him with horrible back pain and "beaten up" knees.   Like most first time students, he walked into that first class not knowing what to expect.  After the challenge and exilaration of that very first class, Chris was hooked!  It didn't take long for him to start enjoying the healing benefits of his Hot Yoga practice as his pain and stress levels diminished. .  His knees and back felt better and he had found a new cardio workout to replace running. Inspired to share what he had discovered with others, he made the decision to become a teacher.  In Fall of 2008 he completed the Bikram teacher training program in Acapulco, Mexico and began teaching in studios all over Long Island.  As his own practice grew, so did his desire to explore other styles of yoga.  Intrigued with the flowing style of vinyasa, Chris went on to complete a 200 hour vinyasa  training in 2013 and now teaches  both styles with his distinct flair.  His students often say how amazing they feel after a "Chris O" class.   Chris says, "I love nothing more than guiding my students through a challenging asana practice, to build healthy and strong minds and bodies  - helping them to lead stronger and healthier lives."</p>

He subsequently sold the studio and moved to Brazil with his wife Karina, also a Bikram teacher. Together,  they opened a hot yoga studio in São Paulo called The Yoga Lab.  Four years later, in 2017, they returned to the north shore of Long Island with their two sons, Fernando and George and their dog Janna.</p>
