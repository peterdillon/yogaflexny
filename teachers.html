			<img src="images/teachers/dana-ptucha-2019.jpg" class="teachers">
			<p>Dana Ptucha started practicing Yoga in 2000 after her mother suggested it as a New Year's resolution. She immediately became a devout student and enjoyed the physical, mental and emotional benefits and yoga became an integral part of her recovery.   For many years, Dana's dedication to hot yoga and her hunger for knowledge led her to numerous seminars and posture clinics throughout the United States. To date Dana has a 500 hour RYT and 200 hour ERYT through Yoga Alliance - holding certificates from Barkan Methods Levels 1, 2 and 3. Dana's passion for hot yoga led her to teach in studios all over Long Island and she soon had a strong following.  Wherever Dana went, they went! Dana is also a certified Personal Trainer through ISSA and enjoys running, spinning and weight training.  Her signature style of teaching hot yoga is a blend of discipline and compassion as she urges her students to work to their full potential every single day.  Dana graduated from the University of Colorado with a BA in Journalism and worked for over 20 years in the corporate world until she decided to pursue the business of yoga full time. Dana's dreams were realized when she developed a partnership with her best friend, Karen Alpert, starting "YogaFlex - Hot Yoga with a Twist", the only studio on Long Island featuring the Hot Barkan Method as well as Barkan's Vinyasa. A true music lover, Dana creates original and eclectic playlists.  Her fast paced and vigorous flow classes are high energy and tons of fun!</p>

			<h5 class="top-margin">Karen Alpert</h5>
			<img src="images/teachers/karen-alpert.jpg" class="teachers">
			<p>Karen Alpert began practicing Ashtanga Yoga in 2002 in search of new ways to restore flexibility, improve balance and increase strength for sports like tennis, running and skiing. Her yoga practice quickly became her passion as she deepened her knowledge and experience through workshops with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, David Swenson, John Friend, and Bryan Kest. Her path soon led her to Hot Yoga and a regular practice of Bikram and Barkan including workshops and seminars with Bikram and Rajashree Choudhary and practicing Barkan Hot Yoga in Sun Valley, ID. In December of 2009 Karen completed her first 200 hour Yoga Alliance Approved Teacher Training in The Barkan Method of Hot Yoga. She began teaching in New York and Idaho and in October 2010 completed Level II Barkan Hot Vinyasa training.  In December that year she partnered with Dana Ptucha to open YogaFlex and fulfill their dream of opening a Hot Yoga Studio. Through conscious sequencing, Karen's classes build and strengthen the relationship between mind and body, breath and movement. Hands on adjustments focusing on alignment and body awareness offer students the opportunity to individualize their practices every day. Karen has an MBA in marketing from NYU Stern School of Business and is the proud mother of three children. Karen flavors her classes with real-life anecdotes and is committed to inspiring her students to take their knowledge of yoga with them when they leave the studio and find balance in their own lives. Always the student, she constantly seeks additional training to grow her own practice as well as her teaching.

			<img src="images/teachers/fawn-candela.jpg" class="teachers">
			<p>I first found Hot Yoga in 2009 when running started to take its toll on my knees and body. I instantly fell in love with the low impact yet intense
				challenge of the poses, the dance-like flow, and THE SWEAT.  I felt an immediate connection to my dance roots and I found my new calling!
				Once the fire was lit I never looked back! After my first training module in 2014 I began teaching Hot Vinyasa.   
				I completed my 200 hour certification a year later. Yoga has helped me not only physically, but also mentally, 
				emotionally and spiritually both in and outside the studio. My soul is forever touched. I respect my yoga practice as 
				I try to flow as the dancer I was when I was 6 years old.</p>
			<p>In 2018 I found Inferno Hot Pilates (IHP) and completed my IHP teacher training with Gabrielle Walters in May of 2019.  Best decision I ever made! 
				My favorite part of being a Hot Yoga/ Inferno Hot Pilates teacher is giving students confidence and positivity while challenging them to do their absolute best.</p>
			<p>I love when I see students leaving class smiling and feeling proud of themselves.</p>
